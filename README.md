# Junday

A guest registration platform for your unforgettable wedding. This is just a project build for a good friend of mine, [Yi Jun Lim](https://www.facebook.com/jun901104).

This project is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) to create a comprehensive easy-to-manage web application.

You may check out the site at [JunDay](http://junday.xyz).
